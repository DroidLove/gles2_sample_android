GLES 2.0 Sample is a sample Android application that does 3D animation
using OpenGL-ES 2.0 (available with Android 2.2 and later). The 2.0
version of OpenGL-ES throws away the traditional OpenGL fixed-function
pipeline (built-in transformation matrix, lighting and materials
functions) in favour of shader programs that you must completely
specify yourself. Google's Java sample code that comes with the
Android SDK includes only the most trivial example of how to write
such shaders; hopefully this sample will be a slightly more
interesting one to learn from and build on.

The source code includes the following Java utility classes:
  * GeomBuilder: basic management of 3D object geometry with choice of
    wireframe or shaded rendering, allowing customization of the
    vertex shader program to implement materials, lighting etc
  * GLUseful: useful OpenGL-related stuff, including error-checking and
    management of shader programs
  * Lathe: uses GeomBuilder to construct objects with rotational symmetry
  * Mat4f: functional operations on matrices representing 3D homogeneous coordinates
  * Vec3f: functional operations on vectors representing 3D coordinates
and the following C utility code:
  * gl_useful.c -- contains an alternative to glGetShaderInfoLog which
    actually works.

When the animation is running, tap the view to bring up a dialog that
allows a choice between shaded and wireframe rendering modes.
